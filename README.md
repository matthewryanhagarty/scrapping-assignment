# Music Blog Scrapper

This is my submission for homework assignment number 14: Scrapping. We were tasked with creating a web application that allows users the ability to 'scrape' a site for content. For my application, I chose to scrape for music blogs. The user can view and leave comments on each of the blogs provided. If a user enjoys a particular blog, they may also 'save' it where the music blog is then moved to the saved tab of my scraping web app. In order to accomplish this, I had to utilize my understanding of jQuery, JavaScript, Cheerio, Express, Axios, Express-Handlebars, Mongoose, Bootstrap, HTML, & CSS.
